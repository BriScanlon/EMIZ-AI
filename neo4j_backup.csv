During a ferry flight from Calgary, Canada to the Maldives, an electrical fire started in the power distribution and generator control box located in the roof of the passenger cabin. The crew isolated the electrical systems and successfully diverted to London Gatwick Airport. The source of the fire was traced to the left generator reverse current relay, which was found to have a different part number to the relays authorised for use on the DHC-6 series of aircraft.
Five Safety Recommendations were made.

C-FAKB was going to make a series of positioning flights starting from Calgary, Canada, finishing in the Maldives. The passenger seats were removed from the aircraft to create space for two 925 litre fuel tanks, which were attached to the floor rails in the cabin and connected to the main fuel system. Two 45 gallon drums were secured to the rear bulkhead in the cabin and one was secured to the floor points behind the forward bulkhead. The drums were filled with fuel, which was to be manually transferred to the 925 litre tanks if unfavourable headwinds were experienced during any of the long over-water legs. Immediately behind the flight deck, on the right side, was an oxygen cylinder, which provided supplementary oxygen to the crew through two

Following work by engineers to diagnose the problem, it was decided to replace the right engine reverse current relay (RCR) and, when the rectification work was complete, the generator functioned correctly.
The aircraft flew three flights, during which the crew experienced no further problems, and at the end of the third flight it landed at Birmingham Airport.

On 23 February 2010, C-FAKB departed from Birmingham Airport at 2336 hrs and climbed to FL170 for a flight to Dubrovnik, Croatia. A few minutes after levelling off for the cruise, the captain noticed “two brief flickers” of the left generator caution light. After discussion with the co-pilot, the commander opened the DC bus tie in order to separate the two DC generator busbars electrically. This action was known to enable continued operation of both generators in circumstances where they were not properly balanced.
Approximately five minutes later, the commander noticed a faint smell, but he and the co-pilot saw nothing abnormal. The crew discussed the symptoms they had observed but decided not to reset the left generator because there had been no steady generator","",,,,

During the final approach to Gatwick Airport, the crew thought that the glow behind the ceiling panels had reduced, but a heat blister had developed on the cabin side of the panels and it was smoking slightly. The aircraft landed, taxied clear of the runway and the crew attempted to shut down the engines. The left engine shut down correctly but, after shutting off the fuel to the right engine it continued to run at between 12% to 15% Ng. The captain thought that the starter motor was probably engaged and stopped the engine by selecting the battery Master Switch to off .
The airport fire crew attended the aircraft and determined that the temperature in the vicinity of the RCRs was slowly increasing. Therefore, they disconnected the aircraft battery from the electrical system and remained with the aircraft until they were satisfied that there was no longer a risk of a fire.","",,,,

General
The aircraft is equipped with a 28VDC electrical system. Each engine is fitted with a starter-generator, which supplies electrical power to its respective DC busbar through a reverse current relay RCR, see Figure 1. A secondary source of DC power is a 24V battery, which feeds the left DC busbar through the battery bus and reverse current circuit breaker. During normal operation the left and right DC busbars are connected by the bus tie, which allows both systems to operate in parallel. The left and right DC electrical systems can operate as separate systems by opening the DC bus tie. A load meter allows the crew to determine the current flowing into or out of the starter generator, its scale indicates between +1 and –1, which corresponds to +200 amps and -200 amps. Movement of the pointer to the instrument stops corresponds to approximately 400 amps.

The purpose of the RCR is to provide a connection between the generator and the bus, or battery, and to provide reverse current protection in the event of a generator failure or a loss of generator voltage. The RCRs are located within the power distribution and generator control box, which is mounted in the roof on the right side of the cabin. Each RCR contains three relays (Figure 2). Relay R1 operates when the generator voltage reaches approximately 22V, relay R2 is a polarized differential relay which senses the direction of the current flow and relay R3 operates the main contacts. A generatorGENERATOR caution light, located on the instrument panel in the cockpit, illuminates when the main contact is open and the engine start switch is at the off position.","",,,,

This energises relay R2, which is connected across the open main contacts. The voltage on the Diff Volt coil of relay R2 is now the difference between the generator voltage and the battery / bus voltage. When this difference reaches between 0.35V and 0.65V (generator must be the highest voltage) relay R2 will close. This applies a voltage to the Main Relay coil R3, which immediately closes and connects the generator to the bus. If the generator voltage decreases below the battery / bus voltage, a current will flow from the bus to the generator. The Rev Current coil in Relay R2 senses the change in direction of the current and the contact opens. The Main Relay coil in Relay R3 is then de-energised, the main contacts open and the generator is disconnected from the bus.","",,,,

Voltage regulator
A voltage regulator is fitted in each generator circuit and controls the generator output at a nominal 28.5V over the full range of generator speed, load and operating temperature. An equalizer circuit in each voltage regulator ensures equal loading (within 20 amps) when the generators are operating in parallel.
Examination of the aircraft
Examination of the aircraft revealed that there had been an electrical fire, which had almost consumed the left RCR, Figure 3. The fire had burnt through the cover of the power distribution and generator control box and, whilst the heat had caused the trim in the cabin to blister,

The aircraft battery appeared, from a visual inspection, to be in good condition and had a voltage of 25.7v.
The power distribution and generator control box was replaced and the aircraft was flown to a maintenance organisation in Switzerland where a detailed inspection of the complete aircraft electrical system was carried out. The maintenance organisation advised the AAIB that whilst the wiring in the aircraft was in a bad general condition..... they could not find any obvious cause for the electrical fire. The complete aircraft wiring was replaced and engine ground runs were carried out to test the electrical generation and distribution system. All the systems operated satisfactorily and the aircraft was flown to the Maldives.

The Type Certificate Holder provided the AAIB with copies of their Service Difficulty Reports detailing 18 failures of the RCR since 1974. Of the 18 occurrences, 15 reports recorded that either the contacts were welded closed or there were signs of overheating, smoke or sparks. Eleven of the RCR were rated at 300 amps and five at 400 amps. There was insufficient information to establish the current rating of the remaining two RCRs.
Significant airworthiness directives, modifications and service bulletins

SB 6/338 was issued on 24 October 1975 and revised on 29 October 1982. This SB requires RCRs rated at 300 amps A-700AP and AAPto be removed from the aircraft and inspected at intervals of not more than 1,200 hours. The inspection requirement is to look for signs of overheating and pitting or corrosion of the contact points.
SB 6/353 was issued on 13 May 1977 and revised on 28 February 1978. This SB introduces heat shielding around the RCR and the rerouting of critical wiring away from the RCRs.
De Havilland Modifications
Modification 6/1585 introduced a new RCR, part number A-701D, rated at 400 amps.
Modification 6/1598 was approved in 1977 and reroutes the electrical wiring adjacent to the RCRs and introduces fire resistant panels in the power distribution and generator control box.

These values were outside the specified limits of 20V to 24V for closing and more than 18V for opening. The RCR was removed from its container and the relay was operated by hand before being retested. During the second test the relay closing and opening voltages were found to be 22.7V and 18.7V respectively, which is within the acceptable limits.
The resistance across the generator and battery terminals was established by measuring the voltage drop when a load bank and standard resistor were connected in series with the RCR. The measured voltage drop was 39.2 mV at 50 amps, which gave a resistance across the contacts of 0.748 mΩ. The specification states that for a maximum

Examination by the Original Equipment Manufacturer
The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) examined the right RCR (part number A-700A) removed at Calgary prior to the ferry flight.
The OEM was of the opinion that the RCR might have been manufactured between 1944 and 1966 when the part number A-700A became obsolete and was replaced with part number A-700AP. The OEM no longer held any drawings for the A-700A units and had no production information for either of the RCRs (part number A-700A) fitted to C-FAKB. They were, therefore, unable to determine if the RCRs were authentic components.","",,,,

The first indication to the crew was the two brief flickers on the left generatorGENERATOR caution caption. It is likely that this was caused by the rapid opening and closing of the main contacts (R3) in the left RCR. With the left generator on-line, it is likely that this action would have resulted in arcing between the moving and fixed contact plates, which may have been sufficient to weld one of the two contacts in the closed position. When the crew checked the DC load meter they noticed that on the left system the needle was fully deflected to the left, and on the right system was partially deflected to the right.

As a result of previous occurrences of RCRs overheating and damaging adjacent components, Transport Canada issued an AD in 1977 that resulted in the introduction of fire resistance panels in the power distribution and generator control box. While the required modification (6/1598) had been embodied on C-FAKB, the heat shields were breached in four places as a result of arcing between the metal components in the RCR and the heat shields. Consequently the DC bus tie, right RCR, battery power cable and several electrical control cables all sustained some damage. The following Safety Recommendation is therefore made to Transport Canada:
Safety Recommendation 2010-083
It is recommended that Transport Canada reviews the design and efficacy of the heat shields fitted around the Reverse Current Relays on De Havilland DHC-6 aircraft that were introduced as a result of Airworthiness Directive CF-77-08.

The pilot, believing that he had an electrical fire,
undertook a precautionary landing. During the ground
run the nose wheel hit a rut causing the aircraft to turn
over on to its back. Both the pilot and passenger were
uninjured. An engineering investigation found that the
alternator drive belt had failed.
History of the flight
The pilot carried out the pre-flight check during which he
confirmed that there was sufficient oil in the engine and
then departed from his home airfield at Andrewsfield on a
local cross country flight. After flying for approximately
35 minutes at a height of 1,800 ft the pilot noticed blue
smoke coming out of the forward section of both sides of
the engine cowling. At the same time the pilot became
aware of a strong smell of electrical burning and
reported hearing a change in the engine noise similar to
when the magneto checks are carried out. He checked
the engine indications, which appeared normal, and
noticed that the low voltage warning light was glowing
very brightly.
The pilot, believing that he had an electrical fire, decided
to make an immediate landing in a large field of wheat
directly ahead of the aircraft. As he closed the throttle
to idle the smoke appeared to stop; nevertheless, he
made a Mayday call to Andrewsfield Radio on 130.55
Mhz and continued with the precautionary landing. The
pilot states that he consulted the emergency checklist
for fire in flight, but elected to leave the electrical
Master Switch ON so that he could operate the flaps
and radio. The aircraft was established on a stable
approach, with a 5 kt tail wind, and once full flaps were
selected, the pilot stated that he turned off the Master
Switch and subsequently held the aircraft in the flare
until the mainwheels touched down at approximately
50 kt. However, as the nose was lowered the aircraft
appeared to come to an abrupt halt and turned over on to
its back. The engine stopped as the propeller struck the
ground and the pilot exited the aircraft through his door
and then assisted the passenger to vacate the aircraft.
Shortly afterwards two farmers and the Police and
Air Ambulance helicopters arrived to offer assistance.
Both the pilot and passenger were unhurt.
Damage to aircraft
The nose landing gear leg was bent back against the
fuselage; the fin, rudder and wings were buckled and
distorted; the windscreen was cracked; one blade on
the propeller was bent; the engine was shock loaded,
the casing on the alternator had suffered impact damage
and the drive belt had failed. There was no evidence of
a fire having occurred.
Comment
From photographs of the accident site and comments
from an engineer who inspected the aircraft it was
established that the aircraft touched down on all three
wheels in a level attitude. The engineer stated that there
was a large rut across the field approximately 12 m
after the touch down point, which he believes caused
the nose landing gear to collapse and the aircraft to turn","",,,,
